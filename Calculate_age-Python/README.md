# ðŸ“Œ Age Calculator (Python Project)

This is a simple **Python project** that calculates a user's age in
**years, months, and days** based on their birth date. It demonstrates
handling of dates, leap years, and basic input/output in Python.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Features

- Accepts user **name, age, and birth date** as input.
- Calculates age in:
  - **Years**
  - **Months**
  - **Days**
- Handles **leap years** accurately.
- Uses Python's built-in **time** and **calendar** libraries.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Requirements

- Python 3.6 or newer

No external libraries are required.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Usage

1.  Save the script as `age_calculator.py`
2.  Run the script:

```bash
python Calculate_age-Python.py
```

3.  Enter your details when prompted (name, age, birth month, and day).
4.  The program outputs your age in years, months, and days.

    elif month == 2 and (not leap_year):

for y in range(begin_year, end_year):
    if (judge_leap_year(y)):
        day = day + 366
    else:
        day = day + 365

leap_year = judge_leap_year(localtime.tm_year)
for m in range(1, localtime.tm_mon):
    day = day + month_days(m, leap_year)

day = day + localtime.tm_mday

leap_birth = judge_leap_year(begin_year)
for m in range(1, birth_month):
    day -= month_days(m, leap_birth)
day -= (birth_day - 1)

print("%s's age is %d years or " % (name, year), end="")
print("%d months or %d days" % (month, day))
