#  PyAutoGUI Paint Auto Draw

This project uses [PyAutoGUI](https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to automate the opening of **MS Paint** and draw a spiral at the center of the screen.  
It‚Äôs a simple but powerful example of how Python can control the keyboard and mouse for desktop automation.

---

## üñåÔ∏è Overview
This script demonstrates how you can use **automation** to:
- Launch Windows applications from Python.
- Control windows and the mouse pointer.
- Automatically draw shapes (in this case, a spiral).

It‚Äôs a practical example of *‚ÄúAutomate the Boring Stuff with Python‚Äù* applied to desktop graphics.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How it Works
1. The script launches `mspaint.exe`.
2. Waits a short time for the Paint window to appear.
3. Maximizes the Paint window using the shortcut `Alt + Space ‚Üí X`.
4. Moves the cursor to the center of the screen and clicks to select the drawing area.
5. Draws a **spiral** using controlled mouse drag movements (`dragRel`).

## üì¶ Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Python libraries:
  - `pyautogui`       (pip install pyautogui)

---

##‚ö†Ô∏è Important:

PyAutoGUI will automatically move your cursor.

To stop the script immediately, move your cursor quickly to the top-left corner of the screen (PyAutoGUI‚Äôs FAILSAFE feature).
